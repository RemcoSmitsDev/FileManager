Thanks for installing FileManger! I hope you'll like using it!

Presentation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FileManager is a package that propose you different *optimized* commands for
managing your files from Sublime Text, such as creating, opening, renaming,
moving, duplicating, etc...

First, you can have a look around at the options it added to your sidebar's
context menu and the command palette, but you really should have a look at the
GitHub's wiki really get 100% of FileManager.

Quick Start Tips:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When you're creating something (pressed alt+n for example), if your path ends
up with a '/', it'll create a folder instead of a file.
- Try to create a folder that already exists ;)
- Have a quick look in here: 'Preferences → Packages Settings → FileManager'

Say thanks:
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ASCII FileManager has been generated using the ASCII Decorator.

Tip of the day: You can bind commands to modifiers-free key combination:
                {
                    "keys": ["-", ">"],
                    "command": "insert_snippet",
                    "args": {
                        "contents": "→ "
                    }
                }

                Once set, each time you'll type '->', it'll insert this '→ '

                If you don't know how to set up shortcuts, don't worry, it's
