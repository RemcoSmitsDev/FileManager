FileManager is a plugin for [Sublime Text 3][st3] that helps you manage your file *from* Sublime Text.

This documentation is still a work in progress, but you can find a significant amount of information, so go have a look!

# Quick Start

You just installed FileManager? Here's a few tips that should get you started:

- press <kbd>alt+n</kbd> to create a file relative to the current opened folder, or, if there is none, the current view, or `C:/Users/<your username>` (`~` for the purists)
- press <kbd>tab</kbd> to go through the auto completions (and <kbd>shift+tab</kbd> to go backwards)
- create and use some [aliases](Aliases)! You already have plenty! For example, you have `$packages`. Try it out!
- Try to create (<kbd>alt+n</kbd>) a folder that *already* exists. You'll see, you're computer will dance the samba! Na, just kidding, but really, give it a go!
- All the command are available from the command palette!

You definitely should have a look here: [commands](commands.md)
