If you want to contribute to the documentation, you're at the right place.
Otherwise, you should have a look [in the readme][0]

### The doc with... MkDoc

I'm using mkdoc to build the documentation. If you've never used it before,
you can install it following [these instructions][1]

The documentation is using the [Material theme][2], so you're going to have to
install it:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/math2001/FileManager
$ cd FileManager
$ virtualenv venv
$
```
