If you want to\nlearn more about about it, \nhere's the page dedicated to it\n\n\nThe log in the status bar\n\n\nAs you probably noticed, when you create a file, there is in the side bar a message, like this\n\n\nCreating at \npath\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOf course, the the \nCreating\n will change if you're moving, renaming, duplicating etc.\n\n\n\n\nAnd the path is in a \ncomputer friendly form\n (\nmore info\n), but you\ncan change it so that it is in a \nuser friendly form\n.\n\n\nlog_in_status_bar\n:\n \nuser\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe valid values are \ncomputer\n, \nuser\n and \nfalse\n\n\nIf it is set to \nfalse\n, it will be disabled (there will be no log in the status bar)\n\n\nThe \"browser\"\n\n\nIf you try to create a file that already exists, it will simply open it.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis is a trick that I realised I was using very often! It's even better when you use\n\naliases\n\n\n\n\nBut what happens if you try to create a \nfolder\n that already exists? Well it's going to show up\na quick panel with every folders and every files listed. If you pick a file, it will open it. If\nyou pick a folder, it will reopen the browser listing all the items of this folder.\n\n\nThere is two more options. The first one is \n..\n, to go up of one folder, and the other one is:\n\nCreate form here\n. If you pick this option, it will simply reopen the input panel from your\nposition in the browser.\n\n\n\n\nSo, again, this is just theory. Read on discover the different commands that uses those features\n(and, of course, add their own \n)\n\n\n\n\nCreate\n\n\nCommand: \nfm_create\n\n\nYou can access it from 2 different ways:\n\n\nRight click on a file/folder in the side bar and choose \nNew\n\n\n\n\nWith this option, you will create \nfrom where you click\n. If it was a file, you will create from\nits \ncontaining folder\n.\n\n\nYou should see an input at the bottom of sublime text. You can type a file name or a path, and it\nwill create it for you. You can use what I call \nuser friendly path\n\n\nExample\n\n\nfolder/file.py\n\n\nIf \nfolder\n does not exists, then it will create it for you.\nIf \nfile.py\n exists, it will open it, otherwise it will create it, and then open it.\n\n\nWith a shortcut \nalt+n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use a shortcut, the plugin does not explicitly know from where you want to create. Here's\nhow it \nguesses\n:\n\n\n\n\nIf there is some folders open in Sublime Text, it will create from the top one\n\n\nOtherwise, if there is file open, it will create from its containing folder\n\n\nFinally, it will choose \n~\n . You can change this fall back by adding to your settings the key\n\npath_fallback\n with the path you want\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there is some folders open in Sublime Text, it will create from the top one\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to select which folder you want to create from, you can just add this prefix: \nnb\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n0\nfile.py\n Creates from the first folder, starting from the top. Here the prefix is useless,\nbecause it's the default value (you could have just typed \nfile.py\n)\n\n\n1\nfile.py\n Creates from the second folder, starting from the top\n\n\n-1\nfile.py\n Creates from the first folder, starting from the \nbottom\n\n\n\n\nYou get the idea.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWatch out, they're \"code lists\", which means that they start from \n0\n. \n0\n is the first one,\n\n1\n is the second, \n2\n is the third, etc...\n\n\n\n\nChanging the symbol (\n)\n\n\nI personally don't like typing the \n, because I have to move my hand a looooong way \n. So,\nI added an option to change it. For my part, I chose a space. The only \"problem\" is that if I have\nthe following structure:\n\n\ntest/\n    1 python/\nsamples/\n    hello/\n    index.html\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that I want to create a file in the folder \n1 python\n, I'm going to type something line this\n\n1 python/afile.py\n. But, it's going select in \nsamples\n. \nSo\n, you would have to explicitly say\nthat you want to create from the first folder, so: \n0 1 python/afile.py\n would work.\n\n\nBut, it's not that much of a big deal, because you rarely get a folder starting with a number and\nthen a space, and as you saw, the solution is really simple.\n\n\nWhy isn't \n  a problem too? On Windows at least, you can \nnot\n have a file are a folder that has\n\n in it.\n\n\nSo, if you want to change the symbol, add this to your settings user\n(it can be, of course, whatever you want):\n\n\nindex_folder_separator\n:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the default index\n\n\nAs I said earlier, the default index is \n0\n. You can change this by adding this to your settings\n\n\ndefault_index\n:\n \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nYou can specify templates so that when you create a new file, the content will be the content of\nyour template. For more information, see \nthe page dedicated to the templates\n\n\nRename\n\n\nCommand: \nfm_rename\n\n\nYou can only rename \n1\n file at a time.\n\n\nIf you put a slash in your name, it will automatically create a sub-folders to it, and then move\nthe file. For example, if you try to rename a file like this: \nhello/world.py\n and your file is\ncalled \nsomething.py\n, it will create the folder \nhello\n (if it doesn't already exists) and then\nrename \nsomething.py\n.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf your name is \n../hello.py\n, it will move your file one folder above.\n\n\n\n\nMove\n\n\nCommand: \nfm_move\n\n\nYou can move several items at a time. If they aren't in the same folder, the path shown in the\ninput will be the common path they have. Once you'll move them, \nthey'll be in every cases in\nthe same folder\n.\n\n\nTo move a file, you're oblige to use the browser, because you have to choose an existing folder, so\nit will automatically pop up. But if you have a look, instead of having \n[cmd]: Create from here\n,\nyou have \n[cmd]: move here\n. As you probably guessed, you have to select this option to move your\nfile/folder\n\n\nDuplicate\n\n\nCommand: \nfm_duplicate\n\n\nYou can duplicate folders and files, but, once again, one at a time.\n\n\nDelete\n\n\nCommand: \nfm_delete\n\n\nFile Manager doesn't delete permanently your files/folders, it only throws them to the trash.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen other commands needs to overwrite a file or a folders, they throw them to the trash\n\nbefore\n and then simply write.\n\n\n\n\nCreate from selection\n\n\nCommand: \nfm_create_from_selection\n\n\nAs its name says, this command allows you to create a file from text. For example, in \nhtml\n, if\nyou right click on the value of an \nsrc\n or \nhref\n attribute, an option will appear called\n\nCreate \nthe path to you file\n (it will be shorten if it's too long). You don't even need to\nselect anything.\n\n\nIf you do select something, then it will propose you to create the file using the path you've\nselected.\n\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n\n\nFont: Droid Sans Mono; Theme: Boxy; Color Scheme: Boxy Yesterday\n\n\nIn every cases, the file will be created \nfrom\n the current file (so this command does not appear\nif you're file is not saved on the disk).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis automatic selection only works, for now, in the following languages:\n\n\n\n\nhtml\n\n\npython\n\n\nphp\n\n\njavascript\n\n\nruby\n\n\n\n\nIf you'd like to see an other language supported, feel free to submit a [new issue][], or even\nto create it yourself. Please make sure you read the \ncontribution-guide\n before doing so.\n\n\n\n\nOpen in browser\n\n\nCommand: \nfm_open_in_browser\n\n\nThis command opens up the selected file in the default browser. You can run it from the command\npalette: \nFile Manager: Open In Browser\n, it'll open the current file. You can also run it from the\nSide Bar: it'll open the selected file(s).\n\n\nIt also kind of \noverwrites\n the default \nOpen in browser\n option in the context menu (in fact, it\nhides default command, and shows the FileManager's command). Now, you might be wondering:\n\n\n\n\nWhy do an other command, while an other one exists?\n\n\n\n\nWell, this one is better \n. Here's how: \nit takes into account a global setting\n \nurl\n\n\nAn example's a great way to explain how it works (in \nMyProject.sublime-project\n):\n\n\n{\n\n    \nfolders\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\n\n            \npath\n:\n \nC:/wamp/www/MyAwesomeWebsite/\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n],\n\n    \nsettings\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nurl\n:\n \nhttp://localhost/MyAwesomeWebsite/\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, when you're going to open a file that is in the the folder \nC:/wamp/www/MyAwesomeWebsite/\n,\nit'll simply replace this part with the \nurl\n value (here \nhttp://localhost/MyAwesomeWebsite/\n)\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nC:/wamp/www/MyAwesomeWebsite/index.html\n \u2192 \nhttp://localhost/MyAwesomeWebsite/\n (it's clever,\nit removes the \nindex.html\n)\n\n\nC:/wamp/www/MyAwesomeWebsite/index.php\n \u2192 \nhttp://localhost/MyAwesomeWebsite/\n\n\nC:/wamp/www/MyAwesomeWebsite/sub-folder/file.php\n \u2192\n\nhttp://localhost/MyAwesomeWebsite/sub-folder/file.php\n\n\n\n\nOpen Terminal Here\n\n\nCommand: \nfm_open_terminal\n\n\nIt opens up the terminal in the selected folder (or the folder of the current file if you open it\nfrom the command palette). You can configure what's happening in your FileManager's settings\n(\nPreferences \u2192 Packages Settings \u2192 FileManager\n).\n\n\nYou can add a setting called \nterminals\n. Here's the format:\n\n\n{\n\n    \nterminals\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nname\n:\n \nterminal name\n,\n\n            \ncmd\n:\n \n[\nthe\n,\n \ncommand\n,\n \nto\n,\n \nopen\n]\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nname\n:\n \nAn other Terminal\n,\n\n            \ncmd\n:\n \n[\nterminal\n,\n \n--new_tab\n,\n \n$cwd\n]\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the \ncmd\n key, you have one variable: \n$\ncwd\n. It'll be replaced by the \ncurrent working dir\n\n(the folder from which the command will be run).\n\n\nSo, for example, on Windows, here's what you could do:\n\n\n{\n\n    \nterminals\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nname\n:\n \nCmder\n,\n\n            \ncmd\n:\n \n[\nC:/cmder/cmder.exe\n,\n \n/SINGLE\n,\n \n$cwd\n]\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nname\n:\n \nCMD\n,\n\n            \ncmd\n:\n \n[\ncmd\n]\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't know what \nCmder\n is, I recommend having a look, it's pretty cool.\n(for Windows user)\n\n\nOn other platform\n\n\nIf you're on Mac, it might be a bit harder. Why? Because I don't have a Mac, so I cannot try to see\nif what I'm going to tell you is \nactually\n working. Here's what I found:\n\n\nopen -a Terminal\n should open a new terminal. So, here's the config I'd recommend using:\n\n\n{\n\n    \nterminals\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nname\n:\n \nTerminal\n,\n\n            \ncmd\n:\n \n[\nopen\n,\n \n-a\n,\n \nTerminal\n]\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it does, doesn't and you have a solution, or needs improvement, please let me know by\n\nraising an issue\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf none of these works for you, and you don't know how to configure this, you can always use\nWill Bond's package \nTerminal\n and \nhide this option (open terminal here)\n\n\n\n\nOpen In Explorer\n\n\nCommand: \nfm_open_in_explorer\n\n\nThis command simply opens the selected item(s) in your file explorer (or finder if you're on mac).\nIt'll open the current file if it's run from the command palette.",
